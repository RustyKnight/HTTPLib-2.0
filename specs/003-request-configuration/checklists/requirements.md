## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Validation run**: 1 of 1 — all items pass on first check
- **Clarifications**: None required; the feature description was brief but unambiguous in intent
- **Key assumptions encoded**: A-01 (replaces FR-011 closure), A-02 (property scope), A-03 (per-request not engine-level), A-09 (MAJOR version bump required — breaking change)
- **Ready for**: `/speckit.plan`
